### Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3 using the Arduino IDE

https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3

New - Uploaded LovyanGFX example. This works for Arduino esp32 v3.x

BEWARE - These examples use LVGL v8.x and Arduino esp32 v2.x.
Neither LVGL v9.x nor Arduino esp32 v3.x will work (yet).
However I'm switching to Lovyan_GFX (from TFT_eSPI)  which does work for Arduino v3.
Next I'll switch to LVGL v9
New examples will be posted soon.

NEW - I've added an example using Arduino_GFX on its own, and another plus LVGL.

Thanks to VollWombat for all his help.

The WaveShare demo software download contains an Arduino branch with code for each of the examples. The most useful is lvg_porting.

They use a customised version of TFT_eSPI which I have avoided. You'll still need the Expander library.

This repository will hopefully grow as I find out how to use all of the board's features.

Also hopefully, it will prove useful to anyone else with this board.

Despite much Googling, no examples turned up, so I'm having to start nearly from scratch.

First, to get the basic graphics going I discovered the wonders of Moononournation's Arduino_GFX library.

Waveshare have thoughtfully given the GPIO pin mapping for their panel, so I put them into the panel constructors -
```
#define GFX_DEV_DEVICE WAVESHARE_ESP32_S3_TFT_4_3
//define GFX_BL 2

Arduino_ESP32RGBPanel *rgbpanel = new Arduino_ESP32RGBPanel(
  5 /* DE */,
  3 /* VSYNC */,
  46 /* HSYNC */,
  7 /* PCLK */,

  1 /* R0 */,
  2 /* R1 */,
  42 /* R2 */,
  41 /* R3 */,
  40 /* R4 */,

  39 /* G0 */,
  0 /* G1 */,
  45 /* G2 */,
  48 /* G3 */,
  47 /* G4 */,
  21 /* G5 */,

  14 /* B0 */,
  38 /* B1 */,
  18 /* B2 */,
  17 /* B3 */,
  10 /* B4 */,

  0 /* hsync_polarity */, 40 /* hsync_front_porch */, 48 /* hsync_pulse_width */, 88 /* hsync_back_porch */,
  0 /* vsync_polarity */, 13 /* vsync_front_porch */, 3 /* vsync_pulse_width */, 32 /* vsync_back_porch */,
  1 /* pclk_active_neg */, 16000000 /* prefer_speed */
);

Arduino_RGB_Display *gfx = new Arduino_RGB_Display(
  800 /* width */,
  480 /* height */, 
  rgbpanel, 
  0 /* rotation */, 
  true /* auto_flush */
);
```
Much to my surprise the example code ran!

Touch is controlled by a GT911, and works well with the bb_captouch library.

SDA=8, SCL=9, IRQ=4

The expansion pin chip can be accessed with ESP_IOExpander_Library.h.
